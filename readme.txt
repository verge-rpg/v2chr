This software and its source code are made available for free, and you may redistribute them for free.
If you want to modify it in some way before distributing it, please contact me before doing so.

I'm not sure if it's the best programming example, as I was age 15 and had a lot to learn,
but if the code contained here is usefult to you, feel free to steal from it.
